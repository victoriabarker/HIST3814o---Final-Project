Downloaded module3-wrangling data from the Crafting digital history github 
-	In order to retrieve access to the blanktemplate.txt file needed 

I decided to work on Atom – I had previously downloaded the program for a past excerise in HIST3814O

Then I opened up the Shawville Equity data. I went through the data and decided to transcribe the first issue of 1973. I found the issue here http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1973/01/03/83471_1973-01-03.pdf

I then opened Atom 

Opened the blanktemplate.txt that I zipped from the module3-wrangling three repo in atom 

I then put – 
<biblScope>pp 1-6</biblScope> 

this is to say which pages I will be transcribing, it is a scope of bibliographic reference.

I found the information about biblscope on this website http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/examples-publisher.html. After wondering if I would be different than the one we used in module 2, exercise 3. 

I put this text between both “bodys” near the end of the blanktemplate.txt, so all the text I will be transcribing from the Shawville article will be written above the second “body”
 
Started transcribing the text
