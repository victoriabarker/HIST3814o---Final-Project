 <p> LOOKING AHEAD

There will be a lot of looking back over the past hundred years during the next twelve months. We’re hoping that with all this retrospection and reminiscing and rejoicing over the old days that some among us will come up with more than just a glance at the future. About twenty years ago we were so bold as to suggest in the pages of  <orgName> The Equity </orgName>  that the municipalities might publish a plan and budget for the coming year. The suggestion was met with stony silence all around the County and nobody has even thought about it since, to our knowledge. We still think that municipalities should be able to plan ahead and publish their plannings for all to see an we still think it will happen here, maybe even in 1973. The Government of <placeName key="Canada" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Canada&params=60_N_95_W_” </placeName> makes its overall plan for legislation very public in the Throne Speech at the opening of each Parliament. This plan then becomes a subject for public debate and the Government proceeds on the basis of the outcome of the debate and the pressure of public opinion. We feel that the time has come when our town councils should think about this way of doing public business. A Centennial is a time for turning over a new leaf if ever there was one. After its over we really should be doing something a little better than we had been doing before. A hundred years behind us should have matured us municipally to the point where we can move ahead boldly and unafraid, with all our cards on the table and the whole town talking. </p>


 <p>117TH FAIR COMING UP

This year, as every year, there will be a <placeName key="Shawville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Shawville%2C_Quebec&params=45_36_N_76_29_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1664)"> </placeName> Fair. We are told that a hundred and seventeen years ago some local farmers brought the best samples of each of their crops into <placeName key="Clarendon Center" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Clarendon%2C_Quebec&params=45_39_N_76_31_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1183)” </placeName> to compare their success. Calves and work horses were tied to a fence for comparison and corn stalks and field roots were lined up side by side for the public to view.Our bet is that at least one good roadhorse race took pace at each of those early agricultural exhibitions and very likely the fierce rivalries were eventually settled at the inn over ale and everyone was friends again at church the following morning.People haven’t changed much in the six score years since our first Fair, but the organization has become extremely complicated.

To cope with the demands of administrative red tape the directorship of an agricultural society is comparable to any other business these days; yet if the whole fair were left in the hands of big businessmen it could lose touch completely with the people it is intended to serve, as big business so often does. So we have to maintain a board of directors who know what calves and work horses and corn and field roots and roadsters are all about and who also are able to contend with all the rules and regulations which have been imposed. </p>


<p> An annual meeting to elect a board of directors for the 1973 <placeName key="Shawville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Shawville%2C_Quebec&params=45_36_N_76_29_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1664)"> </placeName> Fair will be held next Wednesday night, January 10, at 8:30pm., in the Masonic Hall in <placeName key="Shawville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Shawville%2C_Quebec&params=45_36_N_76_29_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1664)"> </placeName>.

 <p> A tribute to the Rt Hon. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>

By <persName> S. Wyman Mackechnie </persName>


Many have been the tributes paid to the memory of <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
since his <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
 death Wednesday evening but the tribute I wish to offer is different from anything you may have read, heard on radio or seen on television. It was not long after <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
election as leader of the National Liberal Party that <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>  was invited to come to <placeName key="Pontiac, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pontiac%2C_Quebec&params=45_35_N_76_08_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(5681)” </placeName> to a dinner in <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>  honour. It was my great privilege to ride with <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> in the back seat of the car and show <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> points of interest as we drove along. And I made the most of it. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> was enthralled with the beauty of the scenery.

<persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> remarked the mountains, the river and the rich farm lands. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> waved. Of course, if a bit modestly, as we drove through <placeName key="Quyon, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Quyon%2C_Quebec&params=45_31_N_76_14_W_region:CA_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki&title=Quyon%2C+Quebec” </placeName>

. And <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
told me a story. When <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>  had been asked to enter the cabinet of <persName key=" St Laurent,Louis" from="1882" to="1973" role="12thth Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_St._Laurent"> </persName> <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> would cease to be a diplomat and become a politician. This was new to <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>. A seat was found for him. <placeName key="Algoma, East" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Algoma_District&params=48_00_N_84_30_W_region:CA-ON_type:city(114094)"> </placeName> was vacant. When the campaign started <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> was toured though the constituency by <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
 predecessor, now <persName key=" Farquharson, Ray" from="1897" to="1965" role="Former PC Leader and Senator " ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Farquharson"> </persName>
, who knew the area like a book. He told <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> to wave. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> dutifully obliged.

<persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> waved and waved. Finally the senator told him, “You can stop waving now, you are out of the constituency!” When I next saw <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName>
 <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> stood at the entrance to the Parliament buildings to welcome the Queen’s Representative to the opening of <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> first parliament as Prime Minister. We had taken out oldest grand-daughter, who was very politically minded at that time, to witness the great event. The next time I saw <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> it was the Centennial Year and Pontiac’s roving ambassador to Expo, Sherrif Joe Sloan, stopped on Parliament Hill en route to meet the Prime Minister, Mr Pearson was ushered out by <placeName key="Pontiac, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pontiac%2C_Quebec&params=45_35_N_76_08_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(5681)” </placeName>’s Member of Parliament, <persName key=" Lefebvre,Thomas" from="1927" to="1992" role="Former Libral Party member" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lefebvre "> </persName> an I was the envy of the professional photographers as they jostled for position, as I was at the horses; very heels. A month or so ago my wife said one evening, “Take me to <placeName key=”Ottawa, Ontario" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Ottawa&params=45_25_N_75_41_W_region:CA-ON_type:city </placeName> tomorrow and I will get your Christmas present.” I thought it was a little early but she explained,” <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> will be there tomorrow and <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> will autograph <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> new book for all purchasers.”We went, the line was long but it a congenial group. All had something in common. An aide moved about cautioning everyone not to ask anything but an autograph. But we would not be deterred. When we got to <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> desk I told him who I was and where I was from and I asked <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> if <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> remembered his trip up into <placeName key="Pontiac, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pontiac%2C_Quebec&params=45_35_N_76_08_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(5681)” </placeName> over twelve years before. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> replied that <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> remembered it very well, it was a tour <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> would never forget. <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> chatted for a moment or two and then <persName key="Pearson, Lester B" from="1897" to="1972" role="14th Prime Minister of Canada" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson"> </persName> autographed the book, “To <persName> S. Wyman Mackechnie </persName>, With Best Wishes, I.B. Pearson”. The book now becomes even more valuable and a constant reminder of a truly great man. </p>


<p> When you complain about improper advertising, we do something about it. Fast. For example: The case of the Magic Mouse
From the flies of the <orgName> Advertising Standards Council</orgName> One day a consumer sent us a “Magic Mouse” Toy. She complained that the television advertising had exaggerated the quality and performance of the product. And after examining the product and the advertising, we agreed. This is the advertising rule that was broken: “No advertisement shall be prepared, or be knowingly accepted, which contains false, misleading, unwarranted or exaggerated claims- either directly or by implication. Advertisers and advertising agencies must be prepared to substantiate their claims.” Here’s what we did about it, immediately.
First we phoned the television station that had run the “Magic Mouse” commercial. They told us they had already cancelled the commercial because of similar complaints. Since the advertiser (a <placeName key="United States of America " ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "> </placeName> company) did not reply to our inquiry , we issued an urgent “bulletin requesting all stations to contact us before accepting advertising from this company. The “Magic Mouse” is no longer advertised.
Keep this complaint notice. If you see dishonest or unfair advertising, send it to us. The <orgName> advertising Standards Council </orgName>is a division of the

 <p> <orgName> Hockey Cultural Program</orgName>

By  <persName> Dick Chapmen  </persName>
of <orgName> The Gazette </orgName>

If you’re between the age of nine an 12 years old and would like to play hockey in the <placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName> , <persName> Bob Beale </persName> wants to hear from you. But there’s a catch: You have to bring the whole team.
When the  <orgName> Quebec Student Inter-Exchange program </orgName> started its <orgName> Hockey Cultural Program</orgName>, what it had in mind was to move further with the French-English exchange visits found so successful (more than 300 students) last summer. <persName> Bob Beale </persName>, QSIP’s executive director, called a press conference to break the news to both sections of the <placeName key="Quebec,Canada " ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Quebec&params=53_N_070_W_type:adm1st_scale:20000000_region:CA-QC "> </placeName> population – and no one notified the English media. “We’re sort of in a dilemma,” <persName> Bob Beale </persName> said last week, after receiving 37 application from French mosquito and pee-wee teams around the <placeName key="Quebec,Canada " ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Quebec&params=53_N_070_W_type:adm1st_scale:20000000_region:CA-QC "> </placeName> .“We’re swamped with applications from the French teams – and don’t have any from the English ones!” </p>

 <p> Exciting deal
And no wonder they’re swamped – besides a weekend with a family of the other tongue, kids get a game at the <placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName> before either a Canadiens’ game or a Red, White and Blue junior match. For the dec. 29-30 weekend, the first hockey “exchange” days on the agenda, <persName> Bob Beale </persName>  has the <placeName key="Montreal, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal&params=45_30_N_73_34_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1649519)”</placeName> East End Boys Club playing against teams from<placeName key="Victoria Ville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Victoriaville&params=46_03_N_71_58_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(45309) "> </placeName>. The mosquitoes play on Friday night and the pee-wees the next afternoon, before the  <orgName> Atlanta Flames </orgName>
Ð	<orgName> Canadiens </orgName> 2pm march.
“We’re going to try and get <persName key=" Gallivan, Danny" from="1917" to="1993" role="Canadian Sports Broadcaster " ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Gallivan "> </persName> and <persName key="Lecavalier, René" from="1918" to="1999" role="Canadian Sports Broadcaster " ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Gallivan "> </persName>
to do some play-by-play for hockey night in <placeName key="Canada" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Canada&params=60_N_95_W_” </placeName>. “ said <persName> Bob Beale </persName>. “They won’t show it the same night, but in the following weeks”. </p>


<p> Needs Balance
The program continues through March 10 but <persName> Bob Beale </persName>  says he won’t be able to match teams for the exchange unless he gets an equal French-English ratio. After a game in the <placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName>, the hope is that all participants will provide a return match in their home towns.
“French and English people in this province have a common denominator,” said <persName> Bob Beale </persName> “Hockey.” “Why not use it to bring them closer together” <persName> Bob Beale </persName>  says the program could lead to adult clubs formed by the parents of the players, similar in structure to Lions or Kiwanis.
<orgName> The Hockey Cultural Program </orgName> took root one day, he said, when <persName key="Bronfman,Peter" from="1929" to="1996" role="Canadian Businessman and entrepreneur" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bronfman "> </persName>
of the <orgName> Canadian Arena Company </orgName> (which owns the <orgName> Canadiens</orgName>) asked him how the <orgName> Canadiens</orgName> could get more involved with youth. <persName> Bob Beale </persName> ran for a draft of his proposal, and with help from the <placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName>’s <persName key="Beliveau,Jean" from="1931" to="2014" role="NHL Hockey Player " ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Béliveau "> </persName> and <persName key="Grundman, Irving" from="1928" to="n/a" role="Former General Manager of the Montreal Canadians" ref=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Grundman "> </persName>, the thing jelled.<placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName> </p>

 <p> Helping
“It’s such a great tribute to the people at the <placeName key="Montreal Forum, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Montreal_Forum&params=45_29_25_N_73_35_5_W_type:landmark_scale:2500” </placeName>” said <persName> Bob Beale </persName>  “They’re really making an effort to bring French and English people together.”What about the cost?
Next to nil, in fact. Players stay the weekend in the home of the opposition, and transportation will be provided and paid for by the <orgName> Hockey Cultural Program</orgName>. If a visiting coach, trainer or organizer doesn’t have convenient lodging in the visiting town, hotel and meals will be arranged and paid for by the program.

A municipality must have ten paid up members to elect a Director. If it happens that less than nine directors are elected and there are no further municipalities with enough members to elect one, then municipalities with less than then members may elect a director. A director must be either a resident or a property holder in the municipality he represents. Also, to be a director or to vote, one must be a member of the Society which costs $2.00 and gets you to the Fair Free. Memberships will be on sale before the meeting next Wednesday evening in the, <placeName key=" Masonic Hall Shawville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Shawville%2C_Quebec&params=45_36_N_76_29_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1664)"> </placeName>. At present there are 76 local members whose membership fees have been deducted from prize cheque for 1972 winnings. Acccording to the new regulations, with the small board of directors, it is more than usually important that each of the directors be the best possible choice and should not go in by default. <orgName> The Agriculture Society </orgName> is hoping for a good turnout next Wednesday so there can be a good election which will result in a good board to organize the <orgName> Shawville Fair </orgName> during the <placeName key="Shawville, Quebec" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Shawville%2C_Quebec&params=45_36_N_76_29_W_region:CA-QC_type:city(1664)"> </placeName> Centennial year. </p>

<p>When you complain about improper advertising, we do something about it. Fast. For example: The case of the Magnetic Bracelet From the files of the <orgName> Advertising Standards Council </orgName>– In an advertisement, a manufacturer claimed that his “magnetic bracelet” possessed therapeutic value for sufferers from various illnesses. This is the advertising rule that was broken: “No advertisement shall be prepared, or be knowingly accepted, which offers false hope in the form of a cure or relief for the mentally or physically handicapped, either on a temporary or permanent basis.” – Here’s what we did about it, immediately. – As soon as the <orgName> Advertising Standards Council </orgName>– received a consumer complaint about the advertisement we contacted the manufacturer and asked him for proof of his claims. We received no direct reply, but he very quickly dropped all reference in advertising to therapeutic values. The bracelet is now sold as an ornament. – Keep this complaint notice. Then if you see advertising that’s dishonest or unfair, sent it to us. – The <orgName> Advertising Standards Council </orgName>– is a division of the <orgName> Canadian Advertising Advisory Board </orgName>. We work for better advertising. </p>
